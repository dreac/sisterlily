           <h1>JAMAICAN BARBEQUE: JERK</h1> 
           
           <p>&ldquo;Jerk&rdquo; is a term used all over Jamaica which is a style of cooking native to the island. Meat 
           (usually chicken or pork) is marinated with a variety of spices; allspice, pimento, scotch bonnet pepper,
           garlic, salt, sugar, ginger...just to name a few. The traditional process of &ldquo;jerking&rdquo; involves 
           slow cooking meat in a barrel container for hours while poking holes in the meat so the marinade 
           can thoroughly saturate the meat. Jerk is no longer exclusive to chicken and pork. Seafood, lamb, 
           tofu, vegetables; if you can eat it, you can jerk it!</p>

           <p>You can find pre-made jerk marinade in your local grocery store or specialty Caribbean market for less 
           than $5. The most popular brands are <a href="https://gracefoods.com/jerk">Grace</a> and 
           <a href="http://www.walkerswood.com/product_traditional_jerk_seasoning.php">Walkerswood</a>. Both
           brands do an incredible job of making both wet and dry marinades that blend all the spices that you 
           would normally need to buy individually saving you a lot of time and money. My granny would use both 
           brands when she didn't have the time to cook it traditionally. You can too!</p>

           <img src="images/jerkchicken.jpg" width="800" height="610" />
           
           <h2>Ingredients</h2>
           <ol>
               <li>2 lbs chicken quartered and cleaned (You can also use this recipe for chicken wings as well).</li>
               <li>Sea salt and black pepper to taste</li>
               <li>3-4 tablespoons of Grace Jerk Seasoning or Walkerswood Jerk Seasoning.</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon of dried thyme or 2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme, chopped</li>
               <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
               <li>1 stalk scallion, chopped
               <li>1 medium yellow onion, chopped</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
           </ol>
           
           <h2>Method</h2>
           
           <p>Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Add chicken and completely marinate and toss. Spices should 
              completely coat chicken. Feel free to poke holes in meat for optimal flavor and heat!  Cover with 
              a plastic wrap and chill overnight <em>or</em> for a minimum of 8 hours.</p>
              
           <p>Build a nice, medium-hot fire over a charcoal grill. You can also add wood chips that have been
              soaked in cold water for 2 hours to add additional flavor. Generously toss chips over charcoal
              when heating grill. The best chips to use for smoking meat is oak. Next, start adding your chicken
              and let cook on one side for 10 minutes. Flip and repeat. Cover grill and slow cook meat, checking
              frequently for 1-2 hours depending on how crispy you want your chicken. After chicken is done, eat it
              the Jamaican way: two slices of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_dough_bread">hard dough bread</a> with ketchup or barbeque sauce to taste.</p>

           <h3>*Granny's Note*</h3>
           <p>You can also cook jerk in the oven if preferred. Follow the same steps for prep and cook for 2-3 hours on 350 
           degrees...adjusting the temperature as needed.</p>
