		<h1>Welcome to Sister Lily's Kitchen</h1>
		<p>There is something special about recipes passed down from our grandmothers. With the recipes comes an archive of traditions, stories, history and culture.
		This site is a tribute to my grandmother, Lillian Maude Fisher...known in a small country town of Collington, Jamaica as &ldquo;Sister Lily&rdquo;. Granny was an entrepreneur, selling
		everything from clothing, housewares, bedding and her specialty: seafood.</p>
		<p>If you wanted the best selection of seafood coming straight from the Caribbean Sea, you would see Sister Lily. Every Monday morning before sunrise, my grandmother would
		travel to the fishing community of Rocky Point, hike up her skirt and meet fishermen right in the middle of the ocean before they could even make it back to shore! She would 
		negotiate prices for the best selections of seafood (mainly fish); parrot fish, goat fish, doctor, welshman, snapper and lobster. After negotiations were made, Sister Lily would pack a 
		container of 60-70 lbs of the freshest fish and deliver to her customers, many who had already placed pre-orders. Granny would often sell out by the following morning! What she didn't sell,
		she would cook in addition to many traditional Jamaican dishes. The one thing that anyone can say was a visit to Sister Lily's house meant a delicious meal. Here is a small collection of her favorite dishes. 
		Add them to your recipe file and get a taste of Jamaica. Welcome to Sister Lily's Kitchen.</p>
