           <h1>OXTAILS</h1>
           <p>Oxtails are THE DISH in most Jamaican households. There is something special about 
              this rich, meaty delight that is often slow cooked with butter beans and served over a 
              steaming plate of rice and peas! Oxtails are usually quite expensive with the cuts varying 
              anywhere from $8-$12/lb. However, it is well worth the splurge as the meat is filling and 
              the conversation guaranteed to be enjoyable around this special dish. It is virtually 
              impossible to be in a bad mood while eating tender cuts of well seasoned meat; meat so 
              delicious that you don&rsquo;t feel guilty for sucking the flavor literally off the bone! 
              Grandma would always make sure that when it was a special occasion, oxtails were a part 
              of the celebration. My take on oxtails is this: Why wait for a special occasion when 
              oxtails ARE the special occasion?</p>

               <li>1 can of lima or broad beans, drained</li>
               <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>

           </ol>
           
           <h2>Method</h2>
           
           <p>Oxtails are generally a tough cut of meat requiring a long cooking time, usually anywhere 
              between 3-4 hours, more if you want the meat sliding right off the bone. Slow cooking in a 
              cast iron pot is strongly recommended.</p>
              
              <img src="images/oxtailsraw.jpg"/>
           <p>Season oxtail with salt, pepper and soy sauce. Set aside and allow to marinate for a minimum
              of at least an hour although overnight is strongly recommended. Heat pot with vegetable oil and 
              add oxtails stirring until oxtails become brown. Make sure to scrap any browned bits at bottom of pot. 
              After, browning, drain any excess oil and add tomato, green and white onions, thyme, and garlic while 
              continuously stirring.</p>
           <p>Next, add the three cups of cool water and reduce heat. Within the second hour of cooking, add
              Grace Oxtail Seasoning to taste and ketchup. Within the last two hours of cooking, add browning
              and scotch bonnet pepper, making sure that the pepper does not burst in the pot. You can
              also slice pepper and remove seeds before adding. A little goes a long way with scotch bonnet
              pepper so add according to how spicy you want your oxtails. Within the last 30 minutes of
              cooking, add broad or lima beans and continue to season with Grace Oxtail Seasoning, salt
              and pepper to acquired taste. If you require a thicker sauce, gradually add another half cup
              of water and another tablespoon of ketchup. Serve with white rice or a Jamaican staple that my 
              grandmother loved, rice and peas.</p>

           <h3>*Granny's Note*</h3> 
           
           <p>You can always adjust the thickness of your oxtail liquid by adding water. Also when shopping for 
              oxtail, look for cuts that are not completely surrounded with fat.</p>
